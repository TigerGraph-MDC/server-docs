= Cluster Resizing
:description: Expand, shrink, or repartition your TigerGraph cluster.
:page-aliases: README.adoc, readme.adoc

As your workload changes, it makes sense to resize your cluster to meet your production needs.
This section describes the steps to perform the following cluster resizing operations:

* xref:expand-a-cluster.adoc[Expand a cluster]
* xref:shrink-a-cluster.adoc[Downsize a cluster]
* xref:repartition-a-cluster.adoc[Repartition a cluster]

[NOTE]
====
All cluster resize operations require downtime lasting several minutes.
The exact amount of downtime varies depending on the amount of data and the number of nodes in the cluster.

You can only resize a cluster once a schema has been created.
If you need to resize a cluster before creating a schema, either:

* Reinstall TigerGraph with the new cluster size, or
* Create a placeholder schema first, then resize.
