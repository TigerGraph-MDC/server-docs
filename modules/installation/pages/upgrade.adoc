:description: Instructions for upgrading an existing TigerGraph installation.

This page describes the steps to upgrade an existing installation of
TigerGraph to TigerGraph {page-component-version}.

== Before you begin
If you are upgrading from a version older than 3.2:

* xref:backup-and-restore:backup-and-restore.adoc[Use GBAR to perform a backup *and restore*] on your existing installation.
This step is necessary because TigerGraph 3.2 made major changes to the Graph Storage Engine and a restore is needed to remove certain files that would make the upgrade operation fail.
* After restoring the backup, ensure that there are no vertex inserts or deletions before starting the upgrade.
