:description: How to management memory usage in TigerGraph.

This page explains the key factors that affect memory usage in TigerGraph, as well as how to:

* Monitor memory usage
* Manage query workload distribution
* Configure memory thresholds

== Memory usage key factors
Below are the major factors that impact memory usage in TigerGraph:

* Data volume
** The biggest factor that affects memory usage in TigerGraph is the amount of data you have.
Most database operations require more memory the more data you have.
* Queries
** Queries that read or write a high volume of data use more memory.
** In a distributed cluster, a non-distributed query can be memory-intensive for the node where the query is run.
See xref:gsql-ref:querying:distributed-query-mode.adoc[].

== Monitor memory usage
You can monitor memory usage by query and by machine.

=== Monitor query memory usage
GPE records memory usage by query at different stages of the query and saves it to `$(gadmin config get System.LogRoot)/gpe/log.INFO`.
You can monitor how much memory a query is using by searching the log file for the request ID and filter for lines that contain `"QueryMem"`:

[source,console]
----
$ grep -i <request_id> $(gadmin config get System.LogRoot)/gpe/log.INFO | grep -i "querymem"
----

You can also run a query first, and then run the following command immediately after to retrieve the most recent query logs and filter for `"QueryMem"`:

[source,console]
----
$ tail -n 50 $(gadmin config get System.LogRoot)/gpe/log.INFO |
    grep -i "querymem"
----

The logs show memory usage by the query at different stages of its execution.
The number at the end of each line indicates the number of bytes of memory utilized by the query:

=== Monitor system free memory percentage

==== Through Admin Portal
If you have access to Admin Portal, you can monitor memory usage by node through the cluster monitoring tool in xref:gui:admin-portal:dashboard.adoc[Dashboard].

==== Through Linux commands
The following is a list of Linux commands to measure system memory and check for out-of-memory errors:

* To check available memory on a node, run link:https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/free.1.html[`free -h`].
** Use with xref:ha:cluster-commands.adoc#_run_commands_on_multiple_nodes[`grun`] to check available memory on every node.
* To view CPU and memory details interactively, run link:https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/top.1.html[`top`].
* When a query is aborted, run link:https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dmesg.1.html[`dmesg -T] | grep -i “oom”` to check for out of memory errors

<1> If you see a line that says something invoked oom-killer, it means the node ran out of memory.

== Memory state thresholds
TigerGraph's Graph Processing Engine (GPE) has memory protection to prevent out-of-memory issues.
There are three memory states:

Healthy:: There is a healthy amount of free memory.
All system operations run normally for best performance.
Alert:: There is a shortage of free memory.
TigerGraph's Graph Processing Engine (GPE) starts to slow down processing new requests to allow long-running queries to finish and release memory.
Critical:: There is a critical shortage of free memory.
TigerGraph's GPE starts to abort queries to ensure system stability.

TigerGraph implements memory protection thresholds through the following environment variables.
By default, the thresholds are only effective when a machine has more than 30 GB of total memory:

`SysAlertFreePct`::
The free memory threshold that causes TigerGraph to enter the Alert state.
Default value is 30%.
`SysMinFreePct`::
The free memory threshold that causes TigerGraph to enter Critical state.
Default value is 10%.

=== Configure memory state thresholds

To configure these environment variables, run `gadmin config entry GPE.BasicConfig.Env`.
This shows the current values of the environment variables and allows you to add new entries:
[.wrap,console]
----
$ gadmin config entry GPE.BasicConfig.Env
✔ New: LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; CPUPROFILE=/tmp/tg_cpu_profiler; CPUPROFILESIGNAL=12; MALLOC_CONF=prof:true,prof_active:false▐
----
Add your desired memory threshold configuration after the existing environment values.
Separate the different environment variables by semicolon `;`:
[.wrap,console]
----
✔ New: LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; CPUPROFILE=/tmp/tg_cpu_profiler; CPUPROFILESIGNAL=12; MALLOC_CONF=prof:true,prof_active:false;SysMinFreePct=5;SysAlertFreePct=25; <1>
----
<1> This sets the critical threshold to 5 percent and the alert threshold to 25 percent.

After entering the new values, run `gadmin config apply` and restart the GPE to have the new configurations take effect.

WARNING: Before modifying the values for the thresholds, please consult https://tigergraph.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/[TigerGraph support].


== Manage query workload
On a distributed cluster, you can specify on which nodes you want a query to be run through the xref:tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc#_run_an_installed_query_post[Run Query REST endpoint].
