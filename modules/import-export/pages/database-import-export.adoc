:description: Instructions for exporting and exporting a TigerGraph database.


The GSQL `EXPORT GRAPH ALL` and `IMPORT GRAPH ALL` commands perform a logical backup and restore.
A database export contains the database's data, and optionally some types of metadata, which can be subsequently imported in order to recreate the same database, in the original or in a different TigerGraph platform instance.

To import an exported database, ensure that the export files are from a database that was running *the exact same version* of TigerGraph as the database that you are importing into.

[WARNING]
====
Known Issues:

* User-defined loading jobs containing xref:gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:creating-a-loading-job.adoc#_delete_statement[`DELETE` statements] are not exported correctly.
* If a graph contains vertex or edge types with a composite key, the graph data is exported in a nonstandard format that cannot be re-imported.
====

== EXPORT GRAPH ALL

The `+EXPORT GRAPH ALL+` command reads the data and metadata for all
graphs in the TigerGraph system and writes the information to a zip file
in the designated folder.
If no options are specified, then a full backup is performed, including schema, data, template information, and
user profiles.

=== Synopsis

----
EXPORT GRAPH ALL [<export_options>] TO "<directory_name>"


exportOptions ::=
(-S | --SCHEMA | -T | --TEMPLATE | -D | --DATA | -U | --USERS | -P | --PASSWORD pwd)


    -S, --SCHEMA        Only Schema will be exported
    -T, --TEMPLATE      Only Schema, Queries, Loading Jobs, UDFs
    -D, --DATA          Only Data Sources will be exported
    -U, --USERS         Includes Permissions, Secrets, and Tokens
    -P, --PASSWORD      Encrypt with password. User will be prompted
----

CAUTION: The export directory should be empty before running the command because all contents are zipped and compressed.

=== Parameters

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|`+directory_name+` |The path of the directory to output export files
to. Must be an absolute path.
|===

=== Options

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Description
|`+-S or --SCHEMA+` |Only export graph schema.

|`+-T+` or `+--TEMPLATE+` |Only export graph schema, queries, loading
jobs and UDFs.

|`+-D+` or `+--DATA+` |Must be used with either `+-S+` or `+-T+`. Export
data in CSV in addition to graph schema or template.

|`+-U+` or `+--Users+` |Must be used with either `+-S+` or `+-T+`.
Export users, role assignments, secrets, and tokens.

|`+-P+` or -`+-Password+` |Encrypt the exported file with a password.
Users will be prompted to enter a password when using this option.
|===

=== Output

The `+EXPORT GRAPH+` command exports all graphs in the database.

The export contains four categories of files:

* Data files in CSV format, one file for each type of vertex and each
type of edge.
* GSQL DDL command files created by the export command. The import
command uses these files to recreate the graph schema(s) and reload the
data.
* Copies of the database's queries, loading jobs, and user-defined
functions.
* GSQL command files used to recreate the users and their privileges.

The following files are created in the specified directory when
exporting and are then zipped into a single file called
ExportedGraphs.zip.

[CAUTION]
====
If the file is password-protected, it can only be unzipped using GSQL IMPORT. The security feature prevents users from directly unzipping it.
====

* A *DBImportExport_<graphName>.gsql* for each graph called <graphName> in a multigraph database that contains a series of GSQL DDL statements that do the following:
 ** Create the exported graph, along with its local vertex, edge, and tuple types,
 ** Create the loading jobs from the exported graphs
 ** Create data source file objects
 ** Create queries
* A *graph_<graphName>/* folder for each graph in a multigraph database containing data for local vertex/edge types in <graphName>. For each vertex or edge type called <type>, there is one of the following two data files:
 ** vertex_<type>.csv
 ** edge_<type>.csv
* *global.gsql* - DDL job to create all global vertex and edge types, and data sources.
* *tuple.gsql* - DDL job to create all User Defined Tuples.
* Exported data and jobs used to restore the data:
 ** *GlobalTypes/* - folder containing data for global vertex/edge types
  *** vertex_name.csv
  *** edge_name.csv
 ** *run_loading_jobs.gsql* - DDL created by the export command which will be used during import:
  *** Temporary global schema change job to add user-defined indexes. This schema job is dropped after it runs.
  *** Loading jobs to load data for global and local vertex/edges.
* Database's saved queries, loading jobs, and schema change jobs
 ** *SchemaChangeJob/ -* folder containing DDL for schema change jobs. See section "Schema Change Jobs" for more information
  *** Global_Schema_Change_Jobs.gsql contains all global schema change jobs
  *** graphName_Schema_Change_Jobs.gsql contains schema change jobs for each graph "graphName"

=== Insufficient Disk Space

If not enough disk space is available for the data to be exported, the system returns an error message indicating not all data has been exported. Some data may have already been written to disk. If an insufficient disk error occurs, the files will not be zipped, due to the possibility of corrupted data which would then corrupt the zip file. The user should clear enough disk space, including deleting the partially exported data, before reattempting the export.

[CAUTION]
====
It is possible for all the files to be written to disk and then to run out of disk space during the zip operation. If that is the case, the system will report this error. The unzipped files will be present in the specified export directory.
====

=== Default Timeout and Session Parameter export_timeout

If the timeout limit is reached during export, the system returns an error message indicating not all data has been exported. Some data may have already been written to disk. If a timeout error occurs, the files will not be zipped. The user should delete the export files, increase the timeout limit and then rerun the export.

The timeout limit is controlled by the session parameter *export_timeout*.  The default timeout is ~138 hours. To change the timeout limit, use the command:

[source,GSQL]
----
SET EXPORT_TIMEOUT = <timeout_in_ms>
----

== IMPORT GRAPH ALL

The `IMPORT GRAPH` command unzips the `.zip` file `ExportedGraph.zip` located in the designated folder, unzips it, and then runs the GSQL command files within.

=== Required privilege
`WRITE_SCHEMA`, `WRITE_QUERY`, `WRITE_LOADINGJOB`, `EXECUTE_LOADINGJOB`, `DROP ALL`, `WRITE_USERS`

=== Synopsis

[source,text]
----
IMPORT GRAPH ALL [import_options] FROM "<filename>"

importOptions ::= [-P | --PASSWORD ] [ (-KU | -- keep-users]
    -P,  --PASSWORD     Decrypt with password. User will be prompted.
    -KU, --KEEP-USERS   Do not delete user identities before importing
----

=== Parameters
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|`+filename+` |The path to the zip file produced by the
`+EXPORT GRAPH ALL+` command. Must be an absolute path.
|===

=== Options
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Description
|`+-P+` or `+--PASSWORD+` |Decrypt with password. You will be prompted
to enter a password when using this option.

|`+-KU+` or `+--KEEP-USERS+` |Keep the current users for during the
import operation. New users from the imported graph will still be added
|===

=== Example


.Example

[source,text]
----
IMPORT GRAPH ALL FROM "/tmp/export_graphs/"
----


[WARNING]
====
`IMPORT GRAPH` looks for specific filenames.  If either the zip file or any of its contents are renamed by the user, IMPORT GRAPH may fail.
====

[WARNING]
====
`IMPORT GRAPH` erases the current database (equivalent to running DROP ALL). The current version does not support incremental or supplemental changes to an existing database (except for the --keep-users option)
====

=== Loading Jobs

There are two sets of loading jobs:

. Those that were in the *catalog* of the database which was exported. These are embedded in the file DBImportExport_graphName.gsql
. Those that are *created by EXPORT GRAPH* and are used to assist with the import process. These are embedded in the file run_loading_jobs,gsql.

The catalog loading jobs are not needed to restore the data. They are included for archival purposes.

[CAUTION]
====
Some special rules apply to importing loading jobs. Some catalog loading jobs will not be imported.
====

. *If a catalog loading job contains `DEFINE FILENAME F = "/path/to/file/"`*, the path will be removed and the imported loading job will only contain *`DEFINE FILENAME F`*.  This is to allow a loading job to still be imported even though the file may no longer exist or the path may be different due to moving to another TigerGraph instance.
. *If a specific file path is used directly in the LOAD statement, and the file cannot be found, the loading job cannot be created and will be skipped.*  For example, `LOAD "/path/to/file" to vertex v1` cannot be created if `/path/to/file` does not exist.
. *Any file path using `$sys.data_root` will be skipped.* This is because the value of `$sys.data_root` is  not retained from export. During import, `$sys.data_root` is set to the root folder of the import location.

=== Schema Change Jobs

There are two sets of schema change jobs:

. Those that were in the catalog of the database which was exported. These are stored in the folder /SchemaChangeJobs.
. Those that were created by EXPORT GRAPH and are used to assist with the import process.  These are in the run_loading_jobs.gsql command file.  The jobs are dropped after the import command is finished with them.

The database's schema change jobs are not executed during the import process. This is because if a schema change job had been run before the export, then the exported schema already reflects the result of the schema change job. The directory /SchemaChangeJobs contains these files:

* *Global_Schema_Change_Jobs.gsql* contains all global schema change jobs
* *<graphName>_Schema_Change_Jobs.gsql* contains schema change jobs for each graph <graphName>.

== Cluster export/import

Importing and exporting clusters is not fully automated in the current version.
The database can be exported and imported by following some additional steps.

=== Export from a Cluster

Rather than creating a single export zip file, the `EXPORT GRAPH ALL` command creates a file for each machine.

To export,  run `EXPORT GRAPH ALL` from the GSQL shell on one node.
The `EXPORT GRAPH` command does not bundle all the files to one server, and it does not compress each server's files to one zip file.
Some files, including the data files, are exported to each server, while some files are only on the local server where `EXPORT GRAPH` was run.

=== Import into a cluster

The following are the steps to import an export file to a cluster.

You may only import to a cluster that has the same number and configuration of servers as the data from which the export originated.

==== 1. Transfer files to new cluster

Transfer the export files from the export servers to the corresponding servers in the new cluster.
For example, the files on the m1 node of the cluster that exported the graphs must be copied to the m1 server on the cluster that is importing the export files.

The export file on every node must share the same absolute path.

==== 2. Run `IMPORT GRAPH ALL`

Run the `IMPORT GRAPH ALL` command from the server that corresponds to the server where `EXPORT GRAPH ALL` was run.

For example, if you exported from the m2 node in a cluster, you also need to run the `IMPORT GRAPH ALL` command from the m2 node of the cluster you are importing the export files into.
