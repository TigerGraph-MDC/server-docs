:experimental:

This tutorial will show you how to start TigerGraph from an image on Google Cloud.

== Deploying Your Instance

. Go to link:https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace[Google Cloud Marketplace] and search for  "TigerGraph Enterprise Edition". Choose the latest edition to access the most up-to-date features.
. Click btn:[Launch].
. Review the default settings and see if they fit your needs.
When ready, click btn:[Deploy].
* The instance type needs to have at least 4 CPUs and 16GB RAM for TigerGraph to work properly.
* You must allow internet traffic for TCP port 14240 if you want to access GraphStudio.
For more about GraphStudio, see the xref:gui:graphstudio:overview.adoc[GraphStudio UI Guide].
* You must allow internet traffic for TCP port 9000 if you want to use TigerGraph's REST API (this includes configuring the GSQL client on a remote machine).

== Starting TigerGraph on Your Instance

. Log into the instance and switch to user `tigergraph` using the following command:
+
[,console]
----
$ sudo su - tigergraph
----
+
. Run the following command to check the current status of TigerGraph.
The services *"ADMIN", "CTRL", "ETCD", "IFM", "KAFKA", and "ZK" are started automatically* and are online at this point. If any of them are down, *please wait for 30 to 60 seconds and check the status again*.

[,console]
----
$ gadmin status
----
. You have successfully started TigerGraph on your cloud instance.

The TigerGraph Enterprise edition image comes with *a perpetual license* that will *only work on the Google Cloud instance it's installed on*.
To view the license, run the following command:
